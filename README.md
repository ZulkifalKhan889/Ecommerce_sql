# Ecommerce SQL Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates advanced SQL skills through the analysis of a real-world ecommerce dataset. The goal is to extract actionable business insights using MySQL queries. The repository includes the dataset, organized SQL queries for analysis, and insights derived from the data. It showcases practical SQL techniques for data analysis, aggregation, and reporting.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of ecommerce transactional records including:

- **Orders:** order IDs, order dates, order numbers  
- **Products:** product IDs, names, categories, prices  
- **Customers:** customer IDs, locations, repeat purchase behavior  

> *Note:* The dataset included here is a sample for demonstration purposes.

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
This project highlights proficiency in the following SQL concepts:

- Writing **SELECT** statements for data retrieval  
- Using **JOINs** to combine multiple tables  
- Applying **GROUP BY** and **aggregation functions** (SUM, COUNT, AVG)  
- Filtering data with **WHERE** and **HAVING** clauses  
- Sorting and ranking results using **ORDER BY**  
- Generating business insights through **subqueries** and **nested queries**

## Key Analysis Questions & Insights
The SQL queries are designed to answer key business questions, such as:

1. **Top Selling Products:** Identify the products generating the most revenue.  
2. **Revenue Trends Over Time:** Analyze monthly or seasonal sales patterns.  
3. **Customer Purchase Behavior:** Determine repeat vs. one-time customers and their contribution to revenue.  
4. **Category Performance:** Rank product categories by sales and profitability.  
5. **Order Analysis:** Evaluate average order value, quantities per order, and sales distribution.
